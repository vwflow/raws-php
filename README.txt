For more information on RAWS and the PHP client libraries, please see the
following wiki pages:
http://wiki.rambla.be
http://code.google.com/p/raws-php/

The raws_json directory contains the PHP libraries (see also INSTALL.txt).

The samples directory shows how to use these libraries.

The direct_uploads directory demonstrates how to use the 'srcencode'
 and 'file_upload' resources (for direct upload by end users). See also:
